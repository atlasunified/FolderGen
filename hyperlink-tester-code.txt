' HYPERLINK TESTER
' This VBA code takes the information in the 'Product Number' Page and offsets 
' the linked information in the cell into the 'Hyperlinks' comlumn.
' If your're a developer, manipulating this information is easy. If you're a
' novice, chances are you aren't reading this, but if you are, just modify the
' information within the rows themselves and keep a mental note of what the data
' represents.
