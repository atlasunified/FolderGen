' HYPERLINK TESTER
' This VBA code takes the hyperlinks from column 'HYPERLINKS' and checks them
' for a 200 or 400 code status response from the website. If it is a good link,
' you'll see a green circle with a checkmark in the column next to the 
' hyperlink column. If it returns a 400, then you'll see a red circle with an
' 'X' inside. This means it returned a bad response and the file may not be there.
' If your're a developer, manipulating this information is easy. If you're a
' novice, chances are you aren't reading this, but if you are, just modify the
' information within the rows themselves and keep a mental note of what the data
' represents.
